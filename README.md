# Configuration File Upload and Graph Generation Server

## Background

In many data-driven applications, visualizing configuration data through graphs can provide valuable insights. This project aims to create a simple yet effective tool for uploading configuration files, processing them to generate graphs, and displaying these graphs as HTML. The server is implemented in Java.

## Task Summary

1. **Goal**: To build an HTTP server that can accept a configuration file, load the data from the file, create a graph (Graph), and display it in the browser.
2. **Packages and Classes**:
    - **configs**: Classes related to configuration and graph definitions.
    - **graph**: Classes related to agents and topics handling.
    - **server**: Classes related to the HTTP server, including servlets handling requests.
    - **views**: Classes related to graph presentation in the browser.
    - **html_files**: Static HTML files used by the system.

## Package Descriptions

### 1. configs
- **BinOpAgent, IncAgent, PlusAgent**: Agents that perform different operations on data received from topics.
- **Config**: Interface for configuration.
- **GenericConfig**: Class that loads a configuration file and creates agents based on the data in the file.
- **Graph**: Class representing a graph of agents and topics.
- **Node**: Class representing a node in the graph.

### 2. graph
- **Agent**: Interface for agents.
- **Message**: Class representing messages sent between agents.
- **ParallelAgent**: Agent running in parallel (in a separate thread).
- **Topic**: Class representing a topic subscribed to by various agents.
- **TopicManagerSingleton**: Class managing all topics in the system.

### 3. server
- **ConfLoader**: Servlet that accepts a configuration file, loads it, and creates a graph.
- **HtmlLoader**: Servlet handling requests for static HTML files.
- **HTTPServer, MyHTTPServer**: Interface and class implementing the HTTP server.
- **RequestParser**: Class parsing HTTP requests.
- **Servlet**: Interface for servlets.
- **TopicDisplayer**: Servlet handling requests for publishing messages to topics.

### 4. views
- **HtmlGraphWriter**: Class generating HTML for graph display.

### 5. html_files
- **form.html**: HTML page allowing configuration file upload and message sending to topics.
- **index.html**: Main HTML page containing iframes for loading other pages.
- **temp.html**: Temporary HTML page.
- **graph.html**: HTML template for graph display.

## Design

The project is designed with modularity and simplicity in mind. Hereâ€™s an overview of the design components:

1. **Server Setup**:
   - The core of the project is an HTTP server (`MyHTTPServer`) that listens for incoming requests and dispatches them to appropriate handlers (servlets).

2. **Servlets**:
   - **`HtmlLoader`**: Handles GET requests to serve static HTML files from the `html_files` directory.
   - **`ConfLoader`**: Handles POST requests for file uploads. It processes the uploaded configuration file, generates a graph, and creates an HTML representation of the graph.
   - **`TopicDisplayer`**: An additional servlet that can be extended to display specific topics or additional data.

3. **Configuration Processing**:
   - **`GenericConfig`**: Reads and parses the uploaded configuration file.
   - **`Graph`**: Constructs a graph based on the parsed configuration data.
   - **`HtmlGraphWriter`**: Converts the graph into an HTML format for visualization.

4. **File Storage**:
   - Uploaded configuration files are stored in the `config_files` directory.
   - Generated HTML files for graphs are also stored in the `config_files` directory.

## Installation

To set up and run this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Set up the required libraries**:
    - Ensure you have the following JAR files in your classpath:
        - `javax.servlet-api-4.0.1.jar`
        - `commons-io-2.11.0.jar`
        - `commons-fileupload-1.4.jar`
    - If you are using an IDE like Eclipse:
        - Right-click on your project and select `Properties`.
        - Go to `Java Build Path` -> `Libraries`.
        - Click `Add External JARs` and select the above JAR files.

3. **Directory structure**:
    - Create the following directories in the root of your project if they do not already exist:
        - `html_files`: For storing the HTML files served by the server.
        - `config_files`: For storing uploaded configuration files and generated graph HTML files.

## Running the Project

To run the server, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the project**:
    - Ensure all Java files are compiled. If you are using an IDE like Eclipse, this should be done automatically.

2. **Start the server**:
    - Run the `Main` class to start the server.


- **Upload a configuration file**:
    - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
    - You should see an upload form. Select a configuration file and click `Upload`.

- **View the generated graph**:
    - After uploading a configuration file, you should be redirected to the generated graph HTML.
    - Alternatively, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/graph.html` to view the latest generated graph.

## File Descriptions

- **`test/Main.java`**: The main entry point for the server.
- **`server/MyHTTPServer.java`**: The custom HTTP server implementation.
- **`server/ConfLoader.java`**: The servlet handling file uploads and processing configuration files.
- **`server/HtmlLoader.java`**: The servlet serving static HTML files.
- **`server/TopicDisplayer.java`**: The servlet handling additional display logic (if any).
- **`configs/GenericConfig.java`**: Class for handling configuration file parsing.
- **`configs/Graph.java`**: Class for creating a graph from the configuration.
- **`views/HtmlGraphWriter.java`**: Class for generating HTML from the graph data.
- **`configs/BinOpAgent.java, IncAgent.java, PlusAgent.java`**: Agents that perform different operations on data received from topics.
- **`configs/Config.java`**: Interface for configuration.
- **`configs/Node.java`**: Class representing a node in the graph.
- **`graph/Agent.java`**: Interface for agents.
- **`graph/Message.java`**: Class representing messages sent between agents.
